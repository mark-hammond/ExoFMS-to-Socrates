# ExoFMS Socrates Documentation

*UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

This is the documentation for the [ExoFms-Socrates code](https://github.com/mark-hammond/ExoFMS-Socrates), which couple the Socrates radiative transfer module to the Exo-FMS GCM.

This repo and documentation also contains instructions for setting up and running any GCM test with Socrates, using HITRAN, HITEMP, or ExoMol data.

Also see how to use Socrates in [ROCKE-3D](https://simplex.giss.nasa.gov/gcm/ROCKE-3D/UserGuidetoSOCRATES_PlanetRadiation_inROCKE3D.html), related [tools](https://github.com/DavidSAmundsen/socrates_tools), and the (password-protected) [Socrates repository](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/socrates).



## Usage

The "socrates_interface" function takes the arguments:

```fortran
CALL socrates_interface(Time, rlat, rlon,     &
     tg_tmp, t_surf, p_full, p_half, n_profile, n_layer,     &
     output_heating_rate, net_surf_sw_down, surf_lw_down, fms_stellar_flux )
```

where the last row is the output.

Diagnostics such as band-averaged fluxes are dealt with inside the interface module.

## Structure

Socrates + ExoFMS has the following structure:

![socrates](soc_diag.png)

1. Call socrates_init at the start of the model run, to read in the spectral files (read_spectrum) and options (read_control)

2. Call socrates_interface at every timestep, to set the input arrays to Socrates (set_atm etc.) then call socrates_calc

3. Socrates_interface sends the diagnostics at every timestep

The intention is that a normal user can change the parameters of their test (longwave spectral file, shortwave spectral file, stellar flux, and Socrates options) without going below the interface level.

More to be added on using clouds etc.


## Edited Files

This code differs from the Socrates repository in the following:

**New Files**
* socrates_interface.F90
* tau_output.F90

Some edited files are needed for optical thickness output.

**Edited Files**
* solve_band_k_eqv.F90 (or whichever solve_band_*.F90)
* radiance_calc.F90
